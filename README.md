Photography-website
This project is about designing a photography website.
Using concepts from UX and UI the first step of this proejct was to complete the design in Figma with a high-fidelity prototype.
Next was optimizing pictures and other images for the website to finally write the HTML and the CSS.
Perhaps I will add some JS effects.
